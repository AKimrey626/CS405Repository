# CS405Repository
This repository contains my completed work for the Green Pace Security Policy project. The main goal of the project was to create a consistent and enforceable set of secure coding practices that the whole team can follow. The policy focuses on defense-in-depth, meaning multiple layers of protection are used together to reduce risks. Inside the repository, I included the ten core security principles, ten C/C++ secure coding standards with examples of compliant and noncompliant code, and a full risk matrix that ranks vulnerabilities by severity, likelihood, and remediation cost. I also developed policies for encryption in flight, at rest, and in use, along with authentication, authorization, and accounting under the Triple-A framework. Another important part of the work is automation, where static analysis, dependency scanning, unit testing, and monitoring are all built into the DevSecOps pipeline so security is enforced continuously rather than at the end of development. The repository also covers audit and enforcement processes to make sure the policies are followed, while pointing out areas for improvement such as expanding monitoring, strengthening key management, and adopting continuous penetration testing. Overall, this project ties together coding standards, policies, and automation into one proactive approach to security that helps Green Pace reduce risks, stay compliant, and build long-term resilience.
